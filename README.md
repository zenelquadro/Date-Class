# 📅 Date Class in Java

## 🧾 Objective

Design and implement a `Date` class in Java to represent dates and perform various operations — including validation, difference calculation, and sorting a list of `Date` objects.

---

## 📦 Features

- Define and manipulate a custom `Date` class.
- Validate dates (including leap years).
- Update date values with validation.
- Calculate the day of the week for any given date.
- Compute the difference in days between two dates.
- Print date in a human-readable format.
- Implement `Comparable<Date>` to support sorting.

---

## 📚 Class Overview

### 🔹 `Date` Class

**Attributes:**
- `int day`
- `int month`
- `int year`

**Constructors:**
- Initialize with specific day, month, and year.

**Methods:**

| Method                          | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `boolean isValidDate()`        | Validates the date (including leap years). |
| `void updateDate(int d, int m, int y)` | Updates the date after validation. |
| `String getDayOfWeek()`        | Returns the day of the week (e.g., "Monday"). |
| `int calculateDifference(Date otherDate)` | Returns difference in days between two dates. |
| `void printDate()`             | Displays the date in readable format like "January 1, 2023". |
| `int compareTo(Date other)`    | Enables sorting by year, month, then day. |

## 🧪 Main Class (Demonstration)

The `Main` class demonstrates the usage of the `Date` class:

- ✅ Creates valid and invalid `Date` objects.
- 🔄 Updates existing `Date` instances.
- 📆 Displays the day of the week.
- 🧮 Calculates day difference between two dates.
- 📊 Sorts an `ArrayList<Date>` using `Collections.sort()`.

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling

- Invalid dates are caught and handled with appropriate error messages.
- Leap year logic is considered for date validation and calculations.

---

## 💡 How to Run

1. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac Date.java Main.java
   ```

2. Run the main program:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- Java 8 or above
- IDE or terminal with Java compiler
